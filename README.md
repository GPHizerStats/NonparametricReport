### Nonparametric Statistical Analysis
##### *"Testing The Effect of School Size on Winning Percentage Across Oklahoma High School Football"*

This report was done for my Spring 2022 Nonparametric Statistics class as a final report. The intent of this file is to show some of my early work in statistics after moving over from being a computer science student. It is also intended to showcase my abilities to take in and analyze data that does not fall within normal distribution and does not have a concise set of parameters surrounding it, so non-traditional statistical tests must be used. 

We were allowed to choose our own topics and datasets, so I chose to look into the affect of school sizes on championships in my home state of Oklahoma. I collected all the data myself for the project.

While this is not my cleanest report, it is one of my earliest ones and it is one I am proud of. I also like seeing how far I came from this report, especially in regards to visualization. I hope you enjoy.
